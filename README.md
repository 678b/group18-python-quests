Python Quests – Group 18

Welcome to the Python Quests Adventure Repository!

This project contains structured Python exercises designed to build programming skills progressively across six levels — from basic printing and variables to logic, loops, functions, and complete mini-applications.

Each group member was required to:

Attempt at least 4 tasks from each of the 6 Levels

Write clean, working Python scripts

Push their solutions to the group GitHub repository

Participate in peer review for assigned groups
